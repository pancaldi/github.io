Cyclistic Bike-Share Co. Data Analysis. 
As a bike-share program, Cyclistic created a network of 692 stations and 5824 bicycles across Chicago in 2016. The company has 2 types of clients: casual riders and annual member riders. Cyclistic believes its future success depends on maximizing annual memberships and for that reason, casual riders must be converted into annual members. For this to happen, Cyclistic must first understand the differences in ridership habits among its clients, hence the purpose of this analysis.
Ridership datasets for the previous 12 months was made available by the Motivate International Inc. under license found at https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement
