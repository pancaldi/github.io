Cyclistic Bike-Share Co. Data Analysis. 

As a bike-share program established in 2016 in Chicago, IL, Cyclistic had created a network of 5,824 bicycles along with 692 stations. There are 2 types of riders for this program: casual riders and annual member riders. Cyclistic has determined that its future growth depends on maximizing the number of annual members by converting casual riders. Before engaging in a campaign to convert casual riders, Cyclistic must first understand the difference in ridership habits among member and casual riders. This analysis is intended to uncover those differences with the help of a 12-month dataset (May 2020 - April 2021) sourced from the Motivate International Inc. under license: https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement
