## Introduction

### In this case study, I examined a 12-month period dataset to evaluate differences in ridership among Cyclistic's clients. Guided by the data analysis steps (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act), I was able to develop an action plan based on findings from the data.

## Problem

### The Cyclistic management team has determined the company's future growth depends on casual riders converting into annual members. I was therefore tasked to find how the ridership habits of casual and annual members differ. The key stakeholders of the project are: Ms. Lily Moreno, my manager and director of marketing, the Cyclistic marketing analytics team, and the Cyclistic executive team.

Ask. An initial meeting with the key stakeholders allowed me to ask
questions, define the problem, use structured thinking, and communicate
with others. The business task was clearly stated: How do annual members
and casual riders use Cyclistic's bikes differently?.

Prepare. To answer the business task, I was able to use Cyclistic's
historical trip data of the past 12 months (May 2020 - April 2021). Data
was made available by the Motivate International Inc. under license. As
an internal data, I collected, weighted it through the ROCCC process,
and secured it. Each of the 12 months data was organized in a table of
13 columns each and thousand of rows. However, the data was found to be
messy.

Process. To begin processing the large dataset, I thought about using a
number of tools such as Spreadsheets, SQL, and R, but in the end I opted
to process it with RMarkdown. As an IDE, RMarkdown allows me to write
reproducible and dynamic reports with R.

### An observation of the structures show Some variables within the columns 'start_station_id' and 'end_station_id' appearing as 'integer' and 'character'. Because the most recent months variables appear as characters, I will be converting the integers from selected months into characters. 


### Aligning the variables in column 'start_station_id' as character for consistency

```{r}
may20 <- mutate(may20, start_station_id=as.character(start_station_id))

jun20 <- mutate(jun20, start_station_id=as.character(start_station_id))

jul20 <- mutate(jul20, start_station_id=as.character(start_station_id))

aug20 <- mutate(aug20, start_station_id=as.character(start_station_id))

sep20 <- mutate(sep20, start_station_id=as.character(start_station_id))

oct20 <- mutate(oct20, start_station_id=as.character(start_station_id))

nov20 <- mutate(nov20, start_station_id=as.character(start_station_id))
```


### Aligning variables in the column 'end_station_id' as character for consistency

```{r}
may20 <- mutate(may20, end_station_id=as.character(end_station_id))

jun20 <- mutate(jun20, end_station_id=as.character(end_station_id))

jul20 <- mutate(jul20, end_station_id=as.character(end_station_id))

aug20 <- mutate(aug20, end_station_id=as.character(end_station_id))

sep20 <- mutate(sep20, end_station_id=as.character(end_station_id))

oct20 <- mutate(oct20, end_station_id=as.character(end_station_id))

nov20 <- mutate(nov20, end_station_id=as.character(end_station_id))
```



### Combining the 12 data sets into a single dataframe called 'trips_raw'

```{r}
trips_raw <- bind_rows(may20, jun20, jul20, aug20, sep20, oct20, nov20, dec20, jan21, feb21, mar21, apr21)
```


### Renaming the columns

```{r}
trips_raw <- rename(trips_raw,
                    ride_event=ride_id,
                    bike_class=rideable_type,
                    start_time=started_at,
                    end_time=ended_at,
                    origin_station=start_station_name,
                    origin_station_id=start_station_id,
                    destination_station=end_station_name,
                    destination_station_id=end_station_id,
                    starting_lat=start_lat,
                    starting_lon=start_lng,
                    ending_lat=end_lat,
                    ending_lon=end_lng,
                    rider_status=member_casual)
```



### Verifying the dataframe with the new column names

```{r}
head(trips_raw)
tail(trips_raw)
```


### Checking the structure of the new dataset

```{r}
str(trips_raw)
```


### Checking for duplicates

```{r}
duplicated(trips_raw)
```


### There's no sign of duplicates. Now checking for total missing values

```{r}
sum(is.na(trips_raw))
```


### The dataset shows 191400 missing values. Checking specific columns to locate missing values

```{r}
sum(is.na(trips_raw$destination_station_id))
sum(is.na(trips_raw$origin_station_id))
sum(is.na(trips_raw$ending_lat))
sum(is.na(trips_raw$ending_lon))
```

### It turns out the missing values are concentrated in 4 columns, which are candidates for removal as they are useless and could distort results later on. Our new dataset without missing values will now become 'trips_prime'.

```{r}
trips_prime <- trips_raw %>%
   select(-c(destination_station_id, origin_station_id, ending_lat, ending_lon))
```


### Checking our new dataset

```{r}
glimpse(trips_prime)
```

### Looking good! We're left with 9 columns and 3,742,202 rows

### The columns 'start_time' and 'end_time' must be converted from character into datetime format for better calculations later.

```{r}
trips_prime %>%
   mutate(trips_prime, start_time=as.POSIXct(start_time, tz='UTC'))
```

```{r}
trips_prime %>%
   mutate(trips_prime, end_time=as.POSIXct(end_time, tz='UTC'))
```


### Comparing the columns

```{r}
compare_df_cols(trips_prime)
```


### Checking that the column 'rider_status' and 'bike-class' only contains the corresponding values

```{r}
table(trips_prime$rider_status)
table(trips_prime$bike_class)
```
### The columns look good!

### Creating a date column

```{r}
trips_prime$date <- as.Date(trips_prime$start_time)
```


### Creating a 'Day' column

```{r}
trips_prime$day <- format(as.Date(trips_prime$date), "%d")
```


### Creating a column for 'day_of_week'

```{r}
trips_prime$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(trips_prime$date), '%A')
```


### Creating a 'Month' column

```{r}
trips_prime$month <- format(as.Date(trips_prime$date), '%B')
```


### Ordering the months

```{r}
trips_prime$month <- ordered(trips_prime$month, levels = c("May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December", "January", "February", "March", "April"))
```


### Creating a 'Year' column

```{r}
trips_prime$year <- format(as.Date(trips_prime$date), "%Y")
```


### Converting the time to correct POSIXct format

```{r}
trips_prime$time <- format(trips_prime$start_time, format = "%H:%M:%S")
trips_prime$time <- as.POSIXct(trips_prime$time, format = "%H:%M:%S")
```


### Adding a 'ride_length' column

```{r}
trips_prime$ride_length <- difftime(trips_prime$end_time,trips_prime$start_time, units = "mins")
```


### Checking the structure of the data frame

```{r}
str(trips_prime)
```


### Converting 'ride_length' from factor to numeric for easier calculations

```{r}
is.numeric(trips_prime$ride_length)
```


```{r}
trips_prime$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(trips_prime$ride_length))
```


```{r}
is.numeric(trips_prime$ride_length)
```


### Checking whether some rides have negative figures due to bike removal for maintenance

```{r}
trips_prime$ride_length<0
```


### The data shows some negative ride length. A new data frame 'trips_clean' is now created by excluding the negative rides through the use of the OR "\|" operator. The new data frame 'trips_clean' is the final.

```{r}
trips_clean <- trips_prime[!(trips_prime$origin_station == "HQ QR" | trips_prime$ride_length<0),]
```

### Analyze. At this stage the new data is secured in a new table (trips_clean) and ready for analysis. Data is sorted and filtered with calculations, patterns and relationships are identified, predictions and recommendations through data-driven decisions are made.

## Structure of the new dataframe

```{r}
str(trips_clean)
```

### Our new final dataframe now has 16 columns and 3,731,696 rows

### Summary of 'ride_length' column

```{r}
summary(trips_clean$ride_length)
```

### Mean of ride_length (in minutes) as shown in the summary

```{r}
mean(trips_clean$ride_length)
```

### Maximum ride length or longest ride

```{r}

### Calculating the mode of 'day_of_week' using the modeest function

```{r}
aggregate(trips_clean$day_of_week ~ trips_clean$rider_status, FUN = mfv)
```

### Determining mean, median, and max of ride length by riders

```{r}
aggregate(trips_clean$ride_length ~ trips_clean$rider_status, FUN = mean)

### The results show casual riders' average ride length is high in the month of July compared to the month of May for member riders.


### Exploring the top 10 origin stations used by riders

```{r}
trips_clean %>%
   group_by(rider_status, origin_station) %>%
   summarise(ride_event = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%

   summarise(ride_event = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
   arrange(rider_status, desc(ride_event)) %>%
   slice(1:11)
```
### There's no significant difference. Casual riders commence and end their rides at the same stations.





### SUMMARY of the Analysis.

#### . There are clear differences in ridership habits among members and casual riders. The are also some obvious correlations in seasonal ridership, bike class, and mode day of the week.

#### . After processing, a total of 3,731,696 rides were recorded in the last 12 months, 59% by members and 41% by casual riders.

#### . Member riders tend to ride the most on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, while casuals riders ride the most on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

#### . Ride length for casual riders was more than twice that of members (44 versus 16 minutes, rounded to nearest minute). This could explain that casual riders used bikes for tourism, sightseeing, and kept them much longer while visiting the city. Assumptions are that members used the bikes for work or shopping.

#### . The median ride length is 20.86 minutes for casual users and 11.31 minutes for members, while overall the mean ride length is 27.42 minutes and the median is 14.35.

#### . Docked bikes are the most popular for both members and casual riders.

#### . Saturday is the mode ride day for both members and casual riders, with Sunday leading in ride length for casual riders, and Saturday and Sunday for members.Tuesday is the least in ride length for both users.

#### . Casual riders start and end their trips at the same stations. The top 5 are:

Streeter Dr & Grand Ave

Lake Shore Dr & Monroe.

Millennium Park

Theater on the Lake.

Michigan Ave & Oak St

#### . Members usually start and end their rides at these top 5 stations as well:

Clark St & Elm St

Broadway & Barry Ave

Wells St & Concord Ln

Dearborn St & Erie St.

St. Clair & Erie St.

#### . Seasonally, the months of July, August, and September are the most popular for casual riders, while members ride the most in April, July, August, September, and October. In all, August is the peak month for both casuals and members. January and February are the lowest ride months for both; this is obvious due to the winter weather.






## Share. This step will involve bringing the data to life through effective visuals and data storytelling. Emphasis is placed on making my work accessible to all.


### Loading visualization libraries

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```


#### Weekly comparisons

```{r}
ggplot(data = trips_clean) +
   geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = day_of_week, fill = rider_status)) +
   facet_wrap(~rider_status) +
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "blue"))+
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 35)) +
   labs(title = "Side-by-Side Comparison of Total Weekly Rides", caption = "Data sourced from Motivate International Inc.")
```

### The above visualization confirms 'Saturday' as the mode (peak) day for both type of riders.



#### Combined weekly trips

   labs(title = "Monthly Ridership for Casual Riders", subtitle = "Between May 2020 and April 2021", caption = "Data sourced from Motivate International Inc.")
```
### The above graph shows summer months as very popular, with August being the peak for casual riders.


### Monthly visualizations for annual members riders

```{r}

   group_by(month, rider_status) %>%
   summarise(ride_event = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
   filter(rider_status == 'member') %>%
   ggplot(aes(x=month, y=ride_event, fill = rider_status))+
   geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity')+
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue"))+
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 35))+
   scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+
   labs(title = "Monthly Ridership for Annual Members", subtitle = "Between May 2020 and April 2021", caption = "Data sourced from Motivate International Inc.")
```

### Summer months are also popular with annual members, and it slows down during the winter.


## Act. In this final step, I am making the following 3 recommendations:

### . Since Cyclistic aims to convert casual riders into annual member riders, it is best to focus on advertising that explains the benefits of being annual members. For example, explain the savings associated with annual membership such as discounts and full ride assistance should an unexpected event occur. Moreover, it is best to have a physical advertising presence at casual riders' most popular origin and destination stations as found in this analysis. Seasonally, advertisement campaigns should kick off in the Spring, right before the busy summer months.

### . People respond well to incentives. Casual riders are very active on weekends, and they can be lured by weekend promotions that offer free weekdays' rides upon completion of a set amount of ride hours or minutes between Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

### . More insight on casual riders is warranted. If they are city's residents or locals, then initiatives towards converting them into annual members would be more effective in this scenario because those riders can in addition of advertising learn about the program from friends, co-workers, and family who are members (word of mouth). In this instance, it is best to offer promotions to members who refer a casual rider for annual membership; perhaps a discount on their annual membership. If casual riders are merely tourists or visitors to the city, then programs that encourage longer bike uses are warranted.
